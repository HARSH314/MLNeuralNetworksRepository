# MLNeuralNetworksRepository
Beginning a public repository for all the requisities for implementing baseline Neural Network &amp; other ML Implementations

Henceforth, all meandering ML Implementations will be pushed to this Repository.

### For now, this repository will act as a collection of various Neural Network Implementations through multiple platforms. These include:
    Python Packages: Scikit Learn, PyBrain and bits of Theano
    Java libraries like Neuroph and JavaNet
    C Libraries: OpenCV, FNN etc.
I hope to traverse through as many packages to get a first hand experience of the convenience of each. Will keep updating.

# MLNeuralNetworksRepository
Beginning a public repository for all the requisities for implementing baseline Neural Network &amp; other ML Implementations

Henceforth, all meandering ML Implementations will be pushed to this Repository.

### For now, this repository will act as a collection of various Neural Network Implementations through multiple platforms. These include:
    Python Packages: Scikit Learn, PyBrain and bits of Theano
    Java libraries: DeepLearning4j , Neuroph, JavaNet
    C Libraries: Torch, FNN
    
# DeepLearning4J 
This package is a great way to get started with multi-layer nets and allows configuration of a variety of hyperparameters easily and robustly. DeepLearning4j uses Canova for vectorization of Data which is a rather convenient implementation, similar to *Python statistical libraries* (very useful). 

Finally, and most importantly, this library sufficiently allows for ConvNet and deep-learning implementations (as the name suggests) from the get go with GPU and CUDA support.
Also, Note: Maven is heavily utilized here. So for someone new to it, it'll take some getting used to.

### Files Updated: 
    1. Several Multi-Layer Perceptron Implementations for Sample datasets. 
    2. Logs and paramter/hyperparameters saved in bin and jsons for future reference.
    3. .docx files to log the F1-Scores for each model
